# Theme switch

- Create a functional component named DataFetcher that displays data obtained from an API. (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) ✅
- Use the useState hook to store the data obtained from the API, ensuring correct typing of the data using TypeScript. ✅
- Use the useEffect hook to make the API call when the component mounts. ✅
- Display the data in the user interface. ✅
- Implement a dark theme for the application using the Context API and the useState and useContext hooks. ✅
- Create a context to handle the theme state. ✅
- Provide a theme switcher in the application that updates the theme state using the useState and useContext hooks. ✅
- Ensure that the application styles change according to the selected theme and use TypeScript to type the theme-related data correctly. ✅
- Optional: Optimize the component's performance using useMemo, React.memo, or useCallback to avoid unnecessary calculations or extra renderings. ✅
- Share the public repository or ZIP file once you have completed it. ✅
